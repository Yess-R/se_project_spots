# Project 3: Spots

Image sharing site

## Description

This is a basic image sharing site.

The site starts off with header that is centered on the page whether it is on a desktop or mobile, that is placed using an img tag in html.

The profile is next which consists of a profile avatar, a description and two buttons one to edit the profile and one to create new post. Those are positioned using display flex and flex direction.

Then we move on the the cards that are the images for the site. Here the images are placed in the html using a img tag. The like(heart) button are placed using a background img in the CSS. The image descriptions are placed using a h2 tag in the HTML.

The footer is placed at the bottom of the page with copyright symbol and title of the site.
